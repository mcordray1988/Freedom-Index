## <a name="dec"></a> Description
We looked at Freedom index data to find if there was any correlation between Freedom score and GDP using a multivariate regression.
We also added ethnicity data to find out if the diversity of a country might effect governing styles. We believe this information to be important to the gernal public and informing policy decisions.

## Conclusions
The regrassion Results indicated a correlation of freedom score on GDP using the Least squares method at .64 adjusted R^2. However, Diversity on Freedom score only produced an R^2 of .05

This means that how free a country is can be a fairly good indication of GDP, In this case we must be aware of reverse causality. It could also mean that higher GDP countries can afford more freedoms.
